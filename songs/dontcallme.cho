[C]Don't call me [G]early in the [F]morn[C]ing
[F]Call me what you [C]want to but [Am]leave me [G]alone
[C]Don't call me [G]early in the [F]morn[C]ing
Just[G] leave me till the cows are coming [Am]home
{eoc}

A [G]man or a [C]woman they need the relax[F]ation 
From [C]rising [Am]always at the [F]dawn [G]
And the [C]heart of the matter, tomorrow is a [F]Saturday
And [C]I'll be [Am]lying lying [F]on [G] 

{chorus}

Sad the lad that can't rest contented 
He has a dollar but must have more 
He fills himself with pills to retire with a million
And falls asleep at sixty-four

{chorus}

Fair is fair and I've done my share
My nerves are gettin' on my nerves
If you don't have a pillow of the white swan's feather 
We'll do with a corner for my head 

{chorus}

Just a gentle warning for tomorrow morning 
No big noises near my room
Cars with no exhausts, chickens with the whooping cough 
And milkmen that whistle out of tune

{chorus}

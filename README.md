# Celtic Songbook Collection

## Layout

The `songs` path contains individual `*.cho` files, one per song. These follow the [ChordPro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChordPro) markup format. Each song should include the `{ns}` or `{new_song}` directive at the beginning (to facilitate compilation into larger books), and should include, at least, a `{title}`. If known, the `{key}` may be specified, and the author should be listed as a `{subtitle}`.
